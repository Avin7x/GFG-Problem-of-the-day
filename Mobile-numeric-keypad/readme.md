## ðŸ§© Problem Statement

Given a mobile numeric keypad as shown below:

1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
* 0 #


You can only press buttons which are **not `*` or `#`** (i.e., not at positions `(3,0)` and `(3,2)`). You can move to any of the four directions (up, down, left, right), and pressing the same button consecutively is allowed.

Given a number `N`, your task is to count how many possible numbers of length `N` can be formed using the movement rules mentioned above.

## ðŸ§  Approach

- Use a recursive function with memoization (top-down DP).
- Use a 3D DP array `dp[i][j][n]` to store the result for starting at `(i, j)` with `n` digits remaining.
- Transition includes 5 directions:
  - stay in place
  - move up, down, left, right
- Avoid invalid cells (i.e., `*`, `#`, or out-of-bounds).
